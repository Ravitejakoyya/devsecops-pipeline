## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with your codebase
- GitHub Actions enabled
- SonarCloud account and organization
- Snyk account and API token
- Java 17 installed (required for SonarScanner)
- Node.js installed (if your project is Node-based)

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure SonarCloud

- Create a project in your SonarCloud organization.
- Generate a SonarCloud token with permissions to analyze your project.
- Add the token as a secret in your GitHub repository (e.g., `SONAR_TOKEN`).

### 2. Configure Snyk

- Sign up for Snyk and generate an API token.
- Add the Snyk token as a secret in your GitHub repository (e.g., `SNYK_TOKEN`).
- Make sure your project has supported manifest files (`package.json`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, etc.) in the root or specified directory.

## Running SonarCloud Scanner

### Requirements

- Java 17 must be used to run the SonarCloud scanner, because the scanner requires at least Java 17.

### Typical GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: SonarCloud Scan

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  sonarcloud:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: 'temurin'
          java-version: '17'

      - name: SonarCloud Scan
        uses: SonarSource/sonarcloud-github-action@v1
        with:
          args: >
            -Dsonar.projectKey=your_project_key
            -Dsonar.organization=your_organization
            -Dsonar.host.url=https://sonarcloud.io
            -Dsonar.login=${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
````

**Important:** Make sure to set `java-version: '17'` in your workflow.

## Running Snyk Scan

### Typical GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Snyk Scan

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  snyk:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run Snyk to check for vulnerabilities
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
        with:
          command: test
          working-directory: './' # adjust if your manifests are in subdirectory
```

**Note:** Make sure your project root contains supported target files (`package.json`, `pom.xml`, etc.). Otherwise, Snyk will not detect the project.

---

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### 1. **SonarScanner Java Version Error**

```
java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: ... compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 61.0)
```

* This means SonarScanner requires **Java 17**, but the environment is running Java 11 or lower.
* **Solution:** Update your GitHub Action workflow to use Java 17:

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-java@v3
  with:
    distribution: 'temurin'
    java-version: '17'
```

### 2. **Snyk Unspecified Error: Could not detect supported target files**

* Ensure your repo contains supported manifest files in the directory you are running Snyk from.
* Verify your `working-directory` if manifests are in a subfolder.
* Check Snyk documentation for supported file types: [https://docs.snyk.io/scan-supported-files](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-supported-files)

### 3. **Snyk Authentication Error (SNYK-0005)**

* Make sure your Snyk token is correctly set in GitHub Secrets.
* Confirm the token has necessary permissions and is not expired.
* Use `snyk auth` locally to verify token.
